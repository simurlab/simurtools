## General info
This toolbox provides utilities to deal with the typical problems we find at the SiMuR Lab at the University of Oviedo, related to human and robot motion capture and analysis.

## Technologies
Other toolboxes and Simulink tools are ocassionally used, 
* Robotics Systems Toolbox - version 1.0
* Sensor Fusion Toolbox - version 3.0
* Simscape

## Setup
Describe how to install / setup your local environement / add link to demo version.

## Code Examples
Show examples of usage: `Libraries/html/simurtb_product_page.html`

## Features
the tools provided can be grouped in three categories:
* robot motion related tools
* human motion analysis with IMUs
* general use tools, hardware dependent
The firts group uses the Robotic Systems Toolbox from Matlab a lot, other robot models are included.
The second group usually needs data from sensors, but some database examples are provided in the toolbox. 

To-do list:
* Incorpore tools for Mocap
* Tools for simulation of collaborative robots

## Status
Project is _in progress_
