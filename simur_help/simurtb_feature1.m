%% Robotics related tools
% Simurtools Toolbox(TM) include tools to help in some specific problems related with robots.


%% Rigid Body 3D Representation
% We have several tools to draw an object or a frame in 3D: 

%%
% 
% * <voxel.html voxel: draw a rectangular box>
% * <psolido.html psolido: define a prisma defined by corners>
% * <pframe.html pframe: draw a frame xyz>


%% Robot Manipulators Models
% Tools to model and represent and robot arms, such as the ABB irb-120 in our laboratory:

%%
% 
% * <kin_irb120.html kin_irb120: symbolic direct kinematics matrix for the robot irb-120>
% * <irb120vr.html irb120vr: to use with the Matlab VR Toolbox>
% * <irb120simulink.html irb120simulink: model to use with Simulink>
